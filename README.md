# Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is a more complex dataset

I uses the Weka library to load the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, preprocess it, and apply a classification algorithm (J48 decision tree).

It includes preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of a more advanced classifier (Random Forest) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using the Weka library.

Replace "path_to/breast-cancer-wisconsin.arff" with the actual path to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset ARFF file.

Attribute selection using CfsSubsetEval and GreedyStepwise is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. 

The Random Forest classifier is then used with the RandomSubSpace meta-classifier for more robust classification. Cross-validation is applied, and the results are printed to the console.
